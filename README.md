# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## **Overview of Project**
### Purpose
The overview of the project is to gather and visualize the data used to create a kickstarter for a movie/play. Louise needs more information regarding fundraising goals which can help her reach her goal. The fundraising goal for her play, Fever, came close to reaching the expected goal. Data from other projects can help give some understanding on how to improve with her next project. Some of the data collected from different projects such as fundraising time/length, goal amount, and deadlines helps give a clearer picture on the outcomes of a project. Louise can now compare other kickstarter campaigns with her own to help reach her goal.

## **Analysis and Challenges**
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Data from various kickerstarters provide many different information including how a project fares based on the launch date. A quick overview of the data reveals that there were always more successful outcomes than failed ones no mater which month it was launched. A closer look shows many more trends for this section. The failed kickstarts was steady and consistent ranging from 30 to ~50 durring all times of the year. We can be safe to assume that the launch time of the year does not affect the outcome of the launch. The successful kickstarter data shows a different story where there are substantially more successful kickstarters in the summer months and less in the winter. We can agree that the time of the year does have a play in how many kickstarters are successful. This we can assume is due to warmer weathers, no school durring summer, and people going out more then.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
A lot of the information on outcomes based on goals points towards different trends regarding goals on amount raised. The overall data was split into two sections which was the overall number of projects and the overall percentage of these projects. The data was obviously heavily favored towards total projects that had a goal of less than $10,000. There were less projects for those that had a higher cost. For the kickstarters that had a smaller goal, many were successful. As the goal costs goes up, the number of failed ones increases and eventually evens out at $15,000 to $19,999. A problem comes up when the goal is high because the data of percentage of successfull/failed becomes clouded. There was a high percentage of successful projects from the ranges of $35,000-$44,999. This does not paint clear picture because it does not show the total number of projects (which was very low). The graph for outcomes based on goals also does not show a complete picture and the data used should have come from the straight number rather than from the percentage.
### Challenges and difficulties Encountered
There were not many challenges for this project mainly because most of the data was already provided. The only difficulty was thinking about which part of the data to use and how these can affect what information we want to show. 

##**Results**
-A conclusion we can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is there were far greater number of successful launches durring the summer months. Another conclusion we can generate is that the number of failed launches is not affected my the time of year because it was mainly consistent. 
-We can conclude that there was a much higher change to be successful if the project goal is under $10,000.
-Some of the limilations of this dataset is that it only includes goals and launch dates. Information such as country and time of kickstarting would be helpful.
-Some other possible tables and graphs we can include is the goals based on country or deadline.
