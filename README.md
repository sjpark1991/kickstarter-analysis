# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## **Overview of Project**
### Purpose
The overview of the project is to gather and visualize the data used to create a kickstarter for a movie/play. Louise needs more information regarding fundraising goals which can help her reach her goal. The fundraising goal for her play, Fever, came close to reaching the expected goal. Data from other projects can help give some understanding on how to improve with her next project. Some of the data collected from different projects such as fundraising time/length, goal amount, and deadlines helps give a clearer picture on the outcomes of a project. Louise can now compare other kickstarter campaigns with her own to help reach her goal.

## **Analysis and Challenges**
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Data from various kickerstarters provide many different information including how a project fares based on the launch date. A quick overview of the data reveals that there were always more successful outcomes than failed ones no mater which month it was launched. A closer look shows many more trends for this section. The failed kickstarts was steady and consistent ranging from 30 to ~50 durring all times of the year. We can be safe to assume that the launch time of the year does not affect the outcome of the launch. The successful kickstarter data shows a different story where there are substantially more successful kickstarters in the summer months and less in the winter. We can agree that the time of the year does have a play in how many kickstarters are successful. This we can assume is due to warmer weathers, no school durring summer, and people going out more then.
