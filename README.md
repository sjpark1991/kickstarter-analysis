# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## **Overview of Project**
### Purpose
The overview of the project is to gather and visualize the data used to create a kickstarter for a movie. Louise needs more information regarding fundraising goals which can help her reach her goal. The fundraising goal for her play, Fever, came close to reaching the expected goal. Data from other projects can help give some understanding on how to improve with her next project. Some of the data collected from different projects such as fundraising time/length, goal amount, and deadlines helps give a clearer picture on the outcomes of a project. Louise can now compare other kickstarter campaigns with her own to help reach her goal.
